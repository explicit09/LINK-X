## 🔧 Backend Status Verification

The backend should be running with all files processed. Verify with:

```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:8080  # Should return 404

# Check auth endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/me  # Should return 401
```

## ⏰ Timeline for Testing

1. **Upload file**: Immediate ✅
2. **Click Ask AI**: Immediate response ✅
3. **Loading experience**: 5-15 seconds ⚡ (was 30 seconds - 2 minutes)
4. **Redirect to learn page**: Automatic ✅

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ "Ask AI" immediately shows loading state
- ✅ Loading completes in under 15 seconds (not 2 minutes!)
- ✅ No timeout errors or "file taking longer than expected" messages
